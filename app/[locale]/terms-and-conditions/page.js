          <h3>Beta Service:</h3>
          <p>Certain Services may be provided as closed or open beta services (referred to as "Beta Service" or “Beta Services”) for testing and evaluation purposes. You acknowledge that we have sole authority and discretion to determine the duration of testing and evaluation for Beta Services. Our determination regarding the success of such testing and the decision to offer Beta Services commercially shall be final. Your subscription to any Beta Service does not obligate you to acquire a subscription for any paid Service. We retain the right to wholly or partially discontinue any Beta Services, temporarily or permanently, with or without prior notice to you. You agree that Bizzilo shall not be liable to you or any third party for any harm arising from the modification, suspension, or discontinuation of Beta Services for any reason.</p>

Specifically, it is advised to utilize corporate email addresses. By registering, you agree to: (i) provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted during registration; and (ii) maintain and promptly update the information provided during registration to ensure its accuracy, currency, and completeness.

          <h3>Spamming and Illegal Activities:</h3>
          <p>You acknowledge sole responsibility for the contents of your transmissions through the Services.

          <h3>Fees and Payment Terms:</h3>
          <p>The Services are accessible via subscription plans offered for various durations. Payments for subscription plans with durations of less than one year are exclusively accepted via Credit Card. Your subscription will automatically renew at the conclusion of each subscription period, unless you choose to downgrade your paid subscription to a free plan or notify us of your intention not to renew the subscription. Upon automatic renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the Credit Card previously used for payment. You have the option to update payment details if you prefer to utilize a different Credit Card for renewal payment. To avoid subscription renewal, you must notify us at least seven days prior to the renewal date. Failure to downgrade to a free plan or notify us of your non-renewal intention will be construed as authorization for Bizzilo to charge the subscription fee to the Credit Card last used for payment. Please refer to our Refund Policy for further details.</p>

          <p>Periodically, we may adjust the pricing of any Service or introduce charges for Services currently offered free of charge. Any price increases will take effect upon the expiration of your current billing cycle. You will not be charged for the use of any Service unless you have subscribed to a paid subscription plan.</p>

          <p>In the event that Bizzilo is required to levy taxes such as GST, VAT, sales tax, or similar taxes pursuant to local, state, provincial, or foreign laws in relation to your subscription to our Services ("Taxes"), Bizzilo will invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to remit payment for such Taxes in addition to the subscription fees. Bizzilo will furnish you with an invoice in compliance with the format specified by applicable local, state, provincial, or foreign laws to facilitate your access to applicable input tax credits for the Taxes paid.</p>

          <h3><strong>Organization Accounts and Administrators</strong></h3>
          <p>Upon registering an account for your organization, you may designate one or more administrators. These administrators will possess the authority to configure the Services to meet your organization's requirements and oversee end users within your organization account. If a third party creates and configures your organization account on your behalf, it is likely that such third party assumes the role of administrator for your organization. It is imperative that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third parties, delineating their roles and limitations as an administrator of your organization account.</p>

          <p>You are responsible for (i) maintaining the confidentiality of your organization account password, (ii) appointing competent individuals as administrators to manage your organization account, and (iii) ensuring that all activities associated with your organization account comply with this Agreement. You acknowledge that Bizzilo is not accountable for account administration or internal management of the Services on your behalf.</p>

          <p>It is your responsibility to take necessary measures to prevent loss of control over administrator accounts within your organization. You may establish a procedure for recovering control in the event of such loss by submitting a request via email to <a href="mailto:legal@bizzilo.com">legal@bizzilo.com</a>, provided that the proposed process is acceptable to Bizzilo. In the absence of a specified administrator account recovery procedure, Bizzilo may grant control of an administrator account to an individual providing satisfactory proof of authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold Bizzilo liable for any consequences arising from actions taken in good faith by Bizzilo in this regard.</p>

          <h3><strong>Personal Information and Privacy</strong></h3>
          <p>Any personal information you provide to Bizzilo through the Service is governed by Bizzilo's Privacy Policy. Your decision to utilize the Service signifies your acceptance of the terms outlined in Bizzilo's Privacy Policy. You are accountable for safeguarding the confidentiality of your username, password, and other sensitive information. Furthermore, you are responsible for all activities conducted within your user account, and you agree to promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your user account via email to <a href="mailto:support@bizzilo.com">support@bizzilo.com</a>. Bizzilo disclaims any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by you or any third party as a result of unauthorized access and/or use of your user account or otherwise.</p>

          <h3><strong>Communications from Bizzilo</strong></h3>
          <p>The Service may include certain communications from Bizzilo, such as service announcements, administrative messages, and newsletters. You acknowledge that these communications are integral to the use of the Services. In adherence to our privacy policy, we provide you with the option to opt out of receiving newsletters. However, opting out of newsletters does not apply to service announcements and administrative messages, which you will continue to receive.</p>

          <h3><strong>Complaints</strong></h3>
          <p>In the event that we receive a complaint regarding your activities while using the Services (excluding complaints addressed under the "Grievance Redressal" mechanism), we will forward the complaint to the primary email address associated with your user account. You are required to directly respond to the complainant within 10 days of receiving the forwarded complaint from us and copy Bizzilo in the communication. Failure to respond to the complainant within the specified 10-day timeframe may result in the disclosure of your name and contact information to the complainant, enabling them to pursue legal action against you. You acknowledge that your failure to respond within the designated timeframe constitutes consent for Bizzilo to disclose your name and contact information to the complainant.</p>

          <h3><strong>Grievance Redressal</strong></h3>
          <p>Should you have any grievances, as defined under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, you may contact our Grievance Officer, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@bizzilo.com">support@bizzilo.com</a>.</p>

          <h3><strong>Inactive User Accounts Policy</strong></h3>
          <p>We retain the authority to terminate unpaid user accounts that remain inactive for a continuous period of 120 days. Upon such termination, all data associated with the user account will be permanently deleted. Prior notice of termination will be provided, along with the option to back up your data. The data deletion policy may be enforced for any or all of the Services offered. Each Service is regarded as an independent entity for calculating the period of inactivity. Activity within one Service does not suffice to maintain the active status of your user account in another Service. In cases where an account has multiple users, if at least one user remains active, the account will not be classified as inactive.</p>

          <h3><strong>Hosting Location</strong></h3>
          <p>The geographical location of the cloud facility serving you is contingent upon the mapping of your region/country to available cloud facilities at the time of your account registration. We reserve the right to migrate your account or request you to migrate to a different cloud facility should updates occur in the region/country to cloud facility mapping. It is imperative that you do not mask your internet protocol (IP) address during registration, as your region/country is determined based on your IP address. If, at any point, your actual region/country is found to be different from the region/country in our records, appropriate actions, such as account migration or closure, may be taken by Bizzilo to align your account with the correct region/country. If you are served from a cloud facility outside your region/country and a Bizzilo group entity maintains an office in your region/country, in addition to storing data in the assigned cloud facility, we may also retain a local copy of your data within your region/country.</p>

          <h3><strong>Data Ownership</strong></h3>
          <p>We respect your ownership rights over content created or stored by you. Unless expressly permitted by you, our provision of the Services does not confer upon Bizzilo the license to utilize, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish, or distribute the content created or stored by you for commercial, marketing, or similar purposes. However, you grant Bizzilo permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, publicly display, and publicly perform the content of your user account solely for the purpose of providing the Services to you.</p>

          <h3><strong>User Generated Content</strong></h3>

Any content made public will be accessible through the internet and may be indexed by search engines. You must ensure that private content remains private to avoid inadvertent public access.
