Bizzilo does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16 for its own purposes.

                  <h3>International Data Transfers and Locations:</h3>

                  <p>We may share your personal information and service data within the Bizzilo Group and with third parties engaged by the Bizzilo Group for the purposes outlined above. By using our products and services, or by providing personal information or service data to us in any other manner, you acknowledge that the processing, transfer, and storage of your personal information or service data may occur in the United States of America, the European Economic Area (EEA), and other countries where Bizzilo operates.

                  <h3>Utilization of Automation and Artificial Intelligence:</h3>

                  <p>To enhance productivity and predictive capabilities for our users, we utilize various technologies, including regex parsing, template matching, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. To uphold our commitment to respecting your privacy and confidentiality expectations, we only make limited use of service data for these technologies. This includes using anonymized excerpts of service data to improve algorithm accuracy and utilizing your organization's data to develop organization-specific models. Our automation and artificial intelligence technologies primarily rely on our organization's data, such as internal communications, interactions with customers, internal documents, and information from free and paid external sources.</p>

                  <h3>Handling Do Not Track (DNT) Requests:</h3>

                  <p>Some internet browsers feature 'Do Not Track' (DNT) capabilities, which send a signal (DNT signal) to websites visited, indicating a user's preference not to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard governing how websites should respond to these signals. Therefore, we do not take specific action in response to DNT signals at this time.</p>

                  <h3>External Links and Privacy:</h3>

                  <p>Certain pages on our websites may contain links to external websites not covered by this Privacy Policy.
