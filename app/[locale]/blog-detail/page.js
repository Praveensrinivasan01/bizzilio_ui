                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>The education loan market in India is witnessing significant growth. According to data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the total education loan outstanding across public and private banks stood at ₹1,31,629 crore (as of November 2024) marking a 17% increase from the previous year. This upward trend reflects a growing demand for education financing, presenting a timely opportunity for lenders to tap into this expanding segment.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>However, complex documentation processes, regulatory hurdles, and operational inefficiencies continue to hamper lender efficiency and affect customer experience.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_24'>In this blog, we explore the evolving education loan landscape, highlighting key opportunities for borrowers and financial institutions. We'll also discuss how modern Loan Management Systems (LMS) can help streamline processes, improve compliance, and drive better outcomes for both lenders and students.</p>
                                <h2 className='fontSize32 fontWeight400 salutetext_clr mb_16'>Understanding the market: education loans in India</h2>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>India's education sector continues to expand rapidly, with the overall market estimated at around ₹18.5-19.0 trillion in FY24. This includes both domestic and overseas education markets. While domestic education still holds a larger share, overseas education is seeing faster growth, driven by students seeking global exposure and better academic opportunities.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>In 2023 alone, Indian students spent about ₹5 trillion on overseas education—a number that is expected to double and reach ₹10.5-11.5 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 17%. Factors such as rising tuition fees, living expenses, and the increasing number of students going abroad contribute to this surge.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>The domestic education market, covering everything from K-12 and higher education to coaching, test prep, and e-learning, was valued at ₹13.5-14.0 trillion in FY24 and is expected to grow steadily at 12-13% CAGR over the next five years.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>With the overall cost of education on the rise, especially for international studies, the demand for education financing is set to grow significantly. The total addressable market for lenders offering education loans, particularly for overseas education, is pegged at ₹44-45 trillion between 2024 and 2028.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_16'>According to CRISIL, the assets under management (AUM) for education loans by NBFCs are expected to grow by over 35%, reaching ₹35,000 crore in FY25 alone. The sharp rise reflects the increasing demand for education financing, driven by faster application processes, improved customer experience, and quicker loan disbursals.</p>
                                <p className='fontSize16 fontWeight400 stoneColdtext_clr mb_24'>This opens up a significant opportunity for lenders to enhance their education loan offerings, both in terms of reach and efficiency, and tap into this high-potential segment.</p>
